  - `src/backend/` → Replaced by `packages/backend/src/`
  - `src/frontend/` → Replaced by `packages/frontend/src/`

### Legacy AI Proxy

  - `ai-proxy/ai-proxy.js` → Replaced by `packages/ai-proxy/src/`
  - `ai-proxy/package.json` → Integrated into monorepo
  - `ai-proxy/node_modules/` → Removed (redundant)

### Legacy Configuration Files

- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` → Replaced by updated documentation
- `PROJECT_RESTRUCTURE.md` → Archived (temporary file)

### Legacy Scripts
- `start-local.bat` → Replaced by `npm run legacy:dev`
- `start-local.sh` → Replaced by `npm run legacy:dev`
- `test-workflow.sh` → Replaced by GitHub Actions

### Build Artifacts
- `dist/` → Will be regenerated by new build system
- `node_modules/` (multiple instances) → Managed by monorepo

## New Structure Replaces Old
```
OLD STRUCTURE:                    NEW STRUCTURE:
src/                         →    packages/
├── assist_backend/          →    ├── backend/src/
├── assist_frontend/         →    ├── frontend/src/
├── backend/                 →    ├── (integrated above)
└── frontend/                →    └── (integrated above)

ai-proxy/                    →    packages/ai-proxy/src/

(scattered configs)          →    config/environments/
(scattered docs)             →    docs/
(no CI/CD)                   →    .github/workflows/
```

## Recovery Instructions

If you need to recover any legacy files:

1. **Check Git History**:
   ```bash
   git log --follow <filename>
   git show <commit-hash>:<filepath>
   ```

2. **Restore from Backup** (if created):
   ```bash
   # Legacy files were backed up before deletion
   # Check archive/ directory
   ```

3. **Use Legacy Commands** (temporarily):
   ```bash
   npm run legacy:dev    # Use old development setup
   npm run legacy:build  # Use old build process
   ```

## Migration Benefits

- ✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Clear package boundaries
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration
- ✅ **Scalability**: Monorepo structure supports growth
- ✅ **Testing**: Structured testing framework
- ✅ **CI/CD**: Automated workflows
- ✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs structure
- ✅ **Security**: Environment-based configuration
- ✅ **Collaboration**: Industry-standard practices

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can:

1. **Use legacy scripts** in package.json (prefixed with `legacy:`)
2. **Restore specific files** from git history
3. **Gradually migrate** using hybrid approach
4. **Keep both structures** during transition period
